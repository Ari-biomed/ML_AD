# Multimodal Learning for AD Diagnosis and Early Detection

Welcome to the repository for the research project on "Multimodal Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Early Detection." This project constitutes the work of my master's thesis.

## Graphs Organization
The repository contains a collection of graphs generated during the study, categorized into the following folders:

- Unimodal Late Fusion Boxplots
- Multimodal Late Fusion Boxplots

Each of these main folders contains six subfolders, corresponding to the six tasks we considered:

1. Binary Diagnostic Task
2. Ternary Diagnostic Task
3. 12-month Prognostic Task
4. 24-month Prognostic Task
5. 36-month Prognostic Task
6. 48-month Prognostic Task

## Graphs Contents
Within each subfolder, you'll find graphs representing both the results of experiments conducted using all modalities considered in the study, as well as the outcomes of modalities combined.
